Contibuted by Bj√∂rn Kalkbrenner: https://github.com/terminar

If you haven't done this before, get the "Command Line Tools for Xcode" and git (via https://brew.sh/ - Homebrew?).

- git clone https://github.com/brummbrum/reaKontrol.git
- cd reaKontrol
- git submodule update --init --recursive
- make -f Makefile.osx install

If you just want to compile the shared library and copy it yourself, you can just do `make -f Makefile.osx`, 
the resulting reaper_kontrol.dylib can be found in the `build` directory.
